## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Follow these steps to get Deep Research up and running on your local browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/u14app/deep-research.git
   cd deep-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   You need to modify the file `env.tpl` to `.env`, or create a `.env` file and write the variables to this file.

   ```bash
   # For Development
   cp env.tpl .env.local
   # For Production
   cp env.tpl .env
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # or npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Deep Research.

### Custom Model List

The project allow custom model list, but **only works in proxy mode**. Please add an environment variable named `NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_LIST` in the `.env` file or environment variables page.

Custom model lists use `,` to separate multiple models. If you want to disable a model, use the `-` symbol followed by the model name, i.e. `-existing-model-name`. To only allow the specified model to be available, use `-all,+new-model-name`.

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fu14app%2Fdeep-research&project-name=deep-research&repository-name=deep-research)

### Cloudflare

Currently the project supports deployment to Cloudflare, but you need to follow [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](./docs/How-to-deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages.md) to do it.

### Docker

> The Docker version needs to be 20 or above, otherwise it will prompt that the image cannot be found.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Most of the time, the docker version will lag behind the latest version by 1 to 2 days, so the "update exists" prompt will continue to appear after deployment, which is normal.

```bash
docker pull xiangfa/deep-research:latest
docker run -d --name deep-research -p 3333:3000 xiangfa/deep-research
```

You can also specify additional environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name deep-research \
   -p 3333:3000 \
   -e ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password \
   -e GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... \
   xiangfa/deep-research
```

or build your own docker image:

```bash
docker build -t deep-research .
docker run -d --name deep-research -p 3333:3000 deep-research
```

If you need to specify other environment variables, please add `-e key=value` to the above command to specify it.

Deploy using `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
version: '3.9'
services:
   deep-research:
      image: xiangfa/deep-research
      container_name: deep-research
      environment:
         - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password
         - GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
      ports:
         - 3333:3000
```

or build your own docker compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

### Static Deployment

You can also build a static page version directly, and then upload all files in the `out` directory to any website service that supports static pages, such as Github Page, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc..

```bash
pnpm build:export
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, Deep Research utilizes the following environment variables for server-side API configurations:

Please refer to the file [env.tpl](./env.tpl) for all available environment variables.

**Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

- **Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.

- **Multi-key Support:** Supports multiple keys, each key is separated by `,`, i.e. `key1,key2,key3`.

- **Security Setting:** By setting `ACCESS_PASSWORD`, you can better protect the security of the server API.

- **Make variables effective:** After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project for the changes to take effect.

## üìÑ API documentation

Currently the project supports two forms of API: Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Server-Sent Events API

The Deep Research API provides a real-time interface for initiating and monitoring complex research tasks.

Recommended to use the API via `@microsoft/fetch-event-source`, to get the final report, you need to listen to the `message` event, the data will be returned in the form of a text stream.

#### POST method

Endpoint: `/api/sse`

Method: `POST`

Body:

```typescript
interface SSEConfig {
  // Research topic
  query: string;
  // AI provider, Possible values ‚Äã‚Äãinclude: google, openai, anthropic, deepseek, xai, mistral, azure, openrouter, openaicompatible, pollinations, ollama
  provider: string;
  // Thinking model id
  thinkingModel: string;
  // Task model id
  taskModel: string;
  // Search provider, Possible values ‚Äã‚Äãinclude: model, tavily, firecrawl, exa, bocha, searxng
  searchProvider: string;
  // Response Language, also affects the search language. (optional)
  language?: string;
  // Maximum number of search results. Default, `5` (optional)
  maxResult?: number;
  // Whether to include content-related images in the final report. Default, `true`. (optional)
  enableCitationImage?: boolean;
  // Whether to include citation links in search results and final reports. Default, `true`. (optional)
  enableReferences?: boolean;
}
```

Headers:

```typescript
interface Headers {
  "Content-Type": "application/json";
  // If you set an access password
  // Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_PASSWORD";
}
```

See the detailed [API documentation](./docs/deep-research-api-doc.md).

#### GET method

This is an interesting implementation. You can watch the whole process of deep research directly through the URL just like watching a video.

You can access the deep research report via the following link:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/sse/live?query=AI+trends+for+this+year&provider=pollinations&thinkingModel=openai&taskModel=openai-fast&searchProvider=searxng
```

Query Params:

```typescript
// The parameters are the same as POST parameters
interface QueryParams extends SSEConfig {
  // If you set the `ACCESS_PASSWORD` environment variable, this parameter is required
  password?: string;
}
```

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

Currently supports `StreamableHTTP` and `SSE` Server Transport.

StreamableHTTP server endpoint: `/api/mcp`, transport type: `streamable-http`

SSE server endpoint: `/api/mcp/sse`, transport type: `sse`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deep-research": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/mcp",
      "transportType": "streamable-http",
      "timeout": 600
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Since deep research take a long time to execute, you need to set a longer timeout to avoid interrupting the study.

If your server sets `ACCESS_PASSWORD`, the MCP service will be protected and you need to add additional headers parameters:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deep-research": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/mcp",
      "transportType": "streamable-http",
      "timeout": 600,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_PASSWORD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Enabling MCP service requires setting global environment variables:**

```bash
# MCP Server AI provider
# Possible values ‚Äã‚Äãinclude: google, openai, anthropic, deepseek, xai, mistral, azure, openrouter, openaicompatible, pollinations, ollama
MCP_AI_PROVIDER=google
# MCP Server search provider. Default, `model`
# Possible values ‚Äã‚Äãinclude: model, tavily, firecrawl, exa, bocha, searxng
MCP_SEARCH_PROVIDER=tavily
# MCP Server thinking model id, the core model used in deep research.
MCP_THINKING_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp
# MCP Server task model id, used for secondary tasks, high output models are recommended.
MCP_TASK_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

**Note:** To ensure that the MCP service can be used normally, you need to set the environment variables of the corresponding model and search engine. For specific environment variable parameters, please refer to [env.tpl](./env.tpl).

## üôã FAQs

**Why does my Ollama or SearXNG not work properly and displays the error `TypeError: Failed to fetch`?**

If your request generates `CORS` due to browser security restrictions, you need to configure parameters for Ollama or SearXNG to allow cross-domain requests. You can also consider using the server proxy mode, which is a backend server that makes requests, which can effectively avoid cross-domain issues.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

Deep Research is designed with your privacy in mind. **All research data and generated reports are stored locally on your machine.** We do not collect or transmit any of your research data to external servers (unless you are explicitly using server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to API through your configured proxy if any). Your privacy is our priority.
