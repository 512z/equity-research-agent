### Server-Sent Events (SSE) API

```javascript
import { fetchEventSource } from '@microsoft/fetch-event-source';

fetchEventSource('/api/sse/live', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: 'Analyze Apple investment value',
    provider: 'google',
    thinkingModel: 'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20',
    taskModel: 'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20',
    searchProvider: 'tavily'
  }),
  onmessage(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log(data);
  },
});
```

### GET Method

You can also access research reports directly via URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/sse/live?query=Analyze+Apple&provider=google&thinkingModel=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20&taskModel=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20&searchProvider=tavily
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è MCP Server Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "equity-research": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/mcp",
      "transportType": "streamable-http",
      "timeout": 600
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Since equity research takes a significant time to execute, we recommend setting a longer timeout to avoid interrupting the research process.

## üîç How It Works

Equity Research Agent employs a professional three-phase research methodology:

1. **Stock Selection**: Input a company name or ticker symbol to begin analysis
2. **Research Plan Development**:
   - The system asks about your investment focus
   - Generates a comprehensive equity research plan
   - Creates targeted financial search queries
3. **Financial Data Collection**:
   - Macroeconomic data collection
   - Industry analysis data collection
   - Company-specific data collection
4. **Equity Research Report Generation**:
   - Creates an executive summary with investment rating and target price
   - Provides macroeconomic, industry, and company analysis
   - Delivers valuation analysis and investment recommendations

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Protection

Equity Research Agent prioritizes your privacy. **All research data and generated reports are stored locally on your device**. We do not collect or transmit your research data to external servers (unless you explicitly use server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to the API through your configured proxy).
